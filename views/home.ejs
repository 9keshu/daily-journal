        <span class="bold-imp">There </span>are many reasons why we journal. From  journals, dream journals, gratitude journals to prayer journals, we keep specific journals for different aspects of our life. In the past, many people kept personal journals, where they recorded the day’s events and their observations. Without diarists like Anne Frank and Samuel Pepys, we wouldn’t know much about the personal side of our history.
        Although people nowadays keep blogs or vlogs, and record their lives on social media,
        very few of us jot in a journal and write down our experiences. So why not give it a try?
